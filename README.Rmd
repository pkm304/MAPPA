# MAPPA

This is a standalone version of MAPPA (MAchine learning of Parameter-Phenotype mapping for Analyzing dynamical biological systems models) implemented using the R Shiny package. Please check the website demonstrating a part of MAPPA for interactive figures (<https://phasespace-explorer.niaid.nih.gov>).

## Key concepts for using MAPPA <a name="key_concepts_for_using_MAPPA"></a>

#### PPM (Parameter-Phenotype Map)

A Parameter-Phenotype Map (PPM) consists of parameter space, phenotypic space, and Machine Learning (ML) models connecting parameter space and phenotypic space. ML models can be considered as phenomenological solutions of dynamical models, trained by a data-driven way.

#### Parameter space

A parameter space consists of kinetic parameters of dynamical models and their feasible ranges. As dynamical models become realistic, the dimensionality of the parameter space also increases. Practically we randomly sample parameter combinations to cover the entire parameter space. To intuitively visualize high-dimensional space, we apply t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the sampled parameter combinations to plot in 2D.

#### Phenotypic space

A phenotypic space consists of a single or multiple phenotype(s). Each phenotype is quantitative or categorical values defining a certain aspect of simulation outcomes throughout the parameter space of a dynamical model, such as single cell gene-gene expression correlations or quality factor for oscillation as in the main paper.

#### Machine Learning (ML) model

A ML model is a random forest regression/classification model. Parameter combinations and phenotypes are input data and output data, respectively for training ML models. In realistic dynamical models with high-dimensional parameter spaces, nonlinearity, and stochasticity, analytical solutions to describe quantitative relationships between parameter and phenotypic spaces are often intractable. Here, ML models can be considered as phenomenological solutions of dynamical models, trained by a data-driven way. Not only ML model can predict phenotypes for given parameter combinations, ML models can also output variable importance in global and local levels, which leads us to better understand behaviors of dynamical models.

#### Variable Importance

The random forest algorithm implemented as the randomForest package in R generates variable importance both in the global level averaged for all data points in training sets and in the local level for each individual data points in training sets with the ‘importance’ and ‘localImp’ options turned on, respectively. Variable importance is the most crucial information to understand the systems’ behaviors in terms of the controllability of each of kinetic parameters. Although the global variable importance (GVI) gives a general overview, the behaviors in the neighborhood of each region of the parameter space can differ each other, and the local variable importance (LVI) does capture this aspect. We can cluster the patterns of LVIs with the hierarchical clustering method and visualize them along with t-SNE plots.

#### Parameter key

Each parameter combination is assigned its own parameter key to make it easily distinguishable and accessible. The basic syntax of parameter keys in this paper is to assign the date when parameter combinations are generated and capital letter combinations (e.g., 042015_AAACEZGP).
